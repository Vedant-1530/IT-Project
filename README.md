QuickEvent Hub is an event product rental web platform, similar to Amazon but focused only on renting event-related items. This project allows two main types of users: Sellers and Buyers, with an Admin to oversee the system.
Sellers can list event products for rent, and buyers can browse and book them. The platform supports only Cash on Delivery (COD) as a payment option to ensure sellers get paid when the product is delivered.
This repository includes all frontend and backend source code, developed using JSP, Java Servlets, CSS, and MySQL for the database.
